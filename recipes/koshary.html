        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Koshary is considered one of the most delicious Egyptian dishes. it is the only dish i could eat 4 of in one sitting and still wish my stomach had more space.</p>
        <p>Koshary is a mixture of different cheap ingredients. it combines ingredients used by the common people to deliver a blast of flavors.</p>
        <p>originally koshary was a poor man's food. some people might find it not appealing, or that it contains too much unrelated ingredients, but they would be wrong. what the dish lacks in apperance and class, it makes for in flavor. so i urge you to try it at least once, just make sure you don't get hooked to it as i am!</p>

        <p>The beauty of koshary is that it has no correct sequence, you have to make a pot for each part, and then combine them together in a bowl at the end. so let's discuss how to make each part.</p>
        <!--making cheapeas-->
        <h3>Make The Chickpeas</h3>

        <!-- assembling-->
        <h2>Assemble the Perfect Koshari Bowl</h2>
        <p>Because koshari has several parts to it, you might be wondering how to assemble everything. I made the list in order of how you assemble the bowl starting with the bottom-most layer (being the koshari lentil rice).</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Koshari lentil rice</li>
            <li>Pasta</li>

            <li>Traditional koshari tomato sauce with vinegar</li>
            <li>Fresh red sauce (optional)</li>
            <li>Crispy fried onions</li>
        </ol>

        <!-- tips and tricks-->
        <h2>Tips and Variations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>If using long-grain rice, add a cup more water. Long-grain rice requires more water than short-grain rice.</li>
            <li>If you want to lighten this recipe up, use whole wheat pasta and reduce the amount of oil used for the koshari rice.</li>
            <li>Use the oil from the fried onions in other parts of this recipe. This is a tip I've heard from 2 sources to make the most flavorful koshari.</li>
            <li>The secret to an amazing bowl of koshari is the right portions of each layer. Personally, I go overboard with the fresh red sauce and fried onions. But, experiment for yourself with what you prefer.</li>
        </ul>
