# odin-recipes

This project is made to showcase the basics of HTML and git learned through the first unit of the odin project.
The idea behind this project is to add a home page that contains a list of my favorite recipes.
Each element of that list will contain the ingredients, pictures, method of cooking, and any notes that might make the recipe more tasty.

## what i expect to learn from this project:
	* the basics of git and github
	* when to commit
	* concise commit messages
	* building HTML web pages
	* linking pages to each other
	* adding pictures to pages
	* file structuring
